# An online multiplayer card game
This game was invented by my two brothers-in-law. I was inspired to create an online version.

It is a React Typescript web-app. 

Main libraries (apart from React) include react beautiful-dnd, redux, immer and ramda.

It is a learning project. Over time it has evolved toward a functional programming paradigm.
